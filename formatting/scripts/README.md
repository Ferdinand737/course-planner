#### Other issues

* Currently cannot distinguish between two recommendations if they are separated by "and" (i.e fails to ignore first recommendation since it only matches "recommended" in the second part.

  * Eg: BIOL 444 One of MATH 100, MATH 101 and one of APSC 254, BIOL 202, GEOG 271, PSYO 271, STAT 121, STAT 230.Third-year standing. <font color=yellow>At least three credits of second-year BIOL/EESC</font> and <font color=green>three credits of third-year BIOL/EESC are strongly recommended.</font>
* Currently do not read from electiveTypes.csv
* Currently cannot accommodate "when subject matter is of the same nature" when dealing with exceptions (in the course description)

  * Eg: Credit will be granted for only one of GEOG 426, GWST 426, GEOG 491 and GWST 495 when the subject matter is of the same nature.
